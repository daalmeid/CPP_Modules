Introduction
Hooking is used for many purposes, including debugging and extending functionality. 
Examples might include intercepting keyboard or mouse event messages before they reach an application,
or intercepting operating system calls in order to monitor behavior or modify the function of an
application or another component. It is also widely used in benchmarking programs,
for example to measure frame rate in 3D games, where the output and input is done
through hooking.

Simply put, it is therefore not weird that hooking is the backbone of MiniLibX.
